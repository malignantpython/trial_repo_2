Two road diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could travel both
And be a traveler, long I stood
And looked down as far as I could
To where it bent out in the undergrowth;

Then took the other as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Had worn them really about the same
